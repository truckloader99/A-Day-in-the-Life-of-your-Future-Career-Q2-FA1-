	      <h2>Morning Routine</h2>
	      <p>I start my day early since being prepared is important in medicine. Upon waking, I wear fresh scrubs and a lab coat, which are essential for maintaining hygiene and professionalism. I always bring my stethoscope, ID badge, and a notebook for patient notes, as these items help me in keeping myself organized and efficient. I reach the hospital prior to seven o’clock to go over patient charts and look for any updates from the night. This is important as it helps me know my patients' needs prior to our meetings. The atmosphere in the hospital is busy and concentrated. Nurses are organizing medications, and residents are reviewing their cases. I begin rounds with my team, going from room to room, as teamwork and communication are very important for making great decisions. Each morning serves as a reminder that being a doctor means that we have to remain vigilant, show empathy, and collaborate together to help people in their recovery.</p>
	      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/medical-students/specialty-profiles/what-life-10-specialties-physicians-who-know">American Medical Association</a>, mornings are used to plan treatments and make sure everyone on the team knows what each patient needs. This helps doctors stay organized and ready for anything that might happen later in the day.</p>

	      <h2>Midday Tasks & Projects</h2>
	      <p>As a doctor, I diagnose and treat illnesses, injuries, and other health conditions to help people live healthier lives. Each day, I examine patients, order and interpret tests, prescribe treatments, and offer preventive care. I work closely with nurses, specialists, lab technicians, and administrative staff to make sure every patient gets the care they need. I use tools like stethoscopes, blood pressure monitors, and digital health records to make informed decisions. But more than anything, I use empathy, communication, and critical thinking to guide my actions.</p>
	      <p>According to <a href="https://www.medscape.com/slideshow/2023-day-in-life-6015894">Medscape</a>, this part of the day can be busy and unpredictable, so doctors need to stay focused and ready for anything.</p>

	      <h2>A Story from My Dream Job</h2>
	      <p>Add an inspiring short story or describe a special moment from others who are already working your dream job — like solving a problem, helping someone, or doing something exciting in your job.</p>
	      <p>Dr. Emily Chen, an oncologist, became a fierce patient advocate after her mother was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. When she experienced the system from the patient’s side, she realized how confusing and isolating treatment can be. She began redesigning her clinic’s intake process to make it more empathetic and clear. One patient later told her, “I finally felt seen.” This moment reminded Dr. Chen that solving problems in medicine isn’t just part of her job, it’s emotional. <a href="https://realitypathing.com/5-inspiring-empathy-stories-from-the-healthcare-field/">Source</a></p>
